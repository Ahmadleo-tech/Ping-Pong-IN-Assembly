🏓 Ping Pong Game in Assembly (FAST NUCES – COAL Project)
This is a simple Ping Pong (Pong) game implemented in Assembly Language as part of the Computer Organization & Assembly Language (COAL) course at FAST NUCES.

The game simulates the classic table tennis gameplay using low-level programming concepts such as:

Direct memory manipulation

Hardware interrupts

Keyboard input handling

Frame rendering via loops

🔧 Features
Single-player or two-player mode (optional)

Paddle control using keyboard inputs

Real-time ball movement and collision detection

Score tracking and game-over conditions

💻 Technologies Used
Assembly Language (x86)

TASM / MASM (Turbo/Microsoft Assembler)

DOSBox (for running the game)

📚 Educational Purpose
This project was developed to:

Understand low-level I/O operations

Explore how games were built before high-level engines

Practice hardware-level programming and interrupt handling

🚀 Getting Started
Clone this repository

Open .asm file in TASM/MASM

Compile and run using DOSBox or any x86 emulator
